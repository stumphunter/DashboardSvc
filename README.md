<h1>DashboardApp</h1>
DashboardApp is a simple .Net project used to demonstrate various continuous integration, continuous delivery, and delivery pipeline concepts. Those concepts are independent of this code base. I just wanted a .Net project that has a small foot print, and a highly visible way to view iterative changes during project demonstrations.

<h2>Important source files</h2>
Build.bat - Simple batch file that can be used to compile the solution via command line.
